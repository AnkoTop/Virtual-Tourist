Project 4 Udacity iOS Nanodegree

This app lets you drop pins on a map. As long as they have a green color you can move them around to the exact position you want.
When they are red you can't move them anymore.
Red pins can be deleted with the trash symbol in the callout or you can get information by choosing the (i)nformation symbol.
In the information view you are shown a random collection of max 24 images from Flicker. You can delete individual pictures by double
tapping. A longpress shows you a detailview of the image.
With the bookmark button on the top right you can manage tags for the location.

For developers; it is easy to extend the app with extra functions like searching for locations with certain tags etc. This is up 
you.
